# workday_scheduler_challenge5

## Description

The purpose of this project was to build a simple scheduler for one's workday using the provided jQuery, dayjs and bootstrap apis.

Compared to the last challenge, building a multi-choice quiz, this project was much easier to solve and build. The concepts and ideas of local storage, using loops and event listeners were on display here again. 

Two issues I had at the start involved getting the background colors change to apply to all time block elements and saving all inputs from each time block. Doing further studying lead me to try and incorporate the keyword "this" into those code blocks. That was the change I needed to make them work and hopefully is a piece of knowledge I will keep to tackle similar problems in the future.
